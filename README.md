The program takes two types of input:

Numbers
Operations
Add numbers to the stack by typing a number, and then enter.
Do operations by pressing a numerical key.
Operators can do three things:

Operations between Buffer x and Buffer y
Operations on Buffer x
Manipulations of the stack
Example

2 + 5:
2 enter 5 enter a enter
Since all operations and number pushes are divided by an enter, it's usually written like this:
2 5 a

3 / -1:
3 1 c d

sqrt(9)^cos(3.4):
9 t 3.4 u p
